            <h2 className='text-2xl mb-4 font-semibold'>Our History</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
          Founded in 2003, our company began with a simple mission: to help retailers recover lost shopping carts and reduce their operational costs. What started as a small team with a handful of clients has grown into a nationwide service, trusted by major retail chains across the country.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In our early days, we manually tracked and collected carts. As technology advanced, so did our methods. In 2012, we introduced GPS tracking to our services, revolutionizing the way we locate and recover shopping carts. This innovation not only improved our efficiency but also provided our clients with valuable data on cart usage and loss patterns.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By 2015, we had expanded our services to include comprehensive inventory management and cart maintenance programs. These additions allowed us to offer a full-cycle solution to our clients, from prevention of cart loss to recovery and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we're proud to be at the forefront of shopping cart recovery and management. Our team of dedicated professionals, coupled with our cutting-edge technology, including daily GPS tracking of every cart in your fleet, continues to set the industry standard for efficiency and customer satisfaction.
